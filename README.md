AMU is a performance-monitoring tool designed for World of Warcraft players who want to keep track of their game's performance metrics. The addon displays information such as home and world latency, frames per second (FPS), and overall memory usage from other addons.

Key Features:

    Latency Monitoring: Displays home and world latency in milliseconds, with color-coded indicators for performance (green for optimal, yellow for caution, and red for high latency).
    FPS Display: Monitors and shows the current frames per second, helping players gauge the responsiveness of their game.
    Memory Usage Tracking: Calculates and displays the total memory usage of all loaded addons, allowing users to manage and optimize their gaming experience.
    Memory Cleanup: Offers a "Clean Memory" button that triggers garbage collection to free up memory resources, ensuring smoother gameplay.
